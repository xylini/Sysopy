Najdłuższe czasy można zaobserwować w real time a najkrótsze w system time.
Ten pierwszy prawdopodobnie składa się z system time + user time.

W bibliotece statycznej, dynamicznej jak i dzielonej czasy w wykonania programu 
z dynamiczną alokacją są trochę krótsze przy ich tworzeniu i zapełnieniu jednak
Powtarzane operacje usuwania i dodawania są krótsze w zaalokowanej statycznie.
W każdym przypadku czas wyszukiwania elementu wyniósł 0 (do tego też dążyłem 
Przy projektowaniu biblioteki).
